~~~~~~

This release fixes a bug where the MarcStreamReader failed to parse MARC directories whose entries were not in order.  The patch was supplied by [Thien Ho](https://github.com/cthdev).

The FreeLib-MARC4J project website was also updated. It's now generated using [JBake](http://jbake.org/). Also, the project's POM file now inherits from a parent project (that defines characteristics of the build at a higher level). This keeps this project's POM a little trimmer.

Lastly, the project has been configured to have [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) analyze the project's code.  A [link to this](http://sonar.freelibrary.info/dashboard/index/info.freelibrary:freelib-marc4j) is available on the new [project website](http://projects.freelibrary.info/freelib-marc4j/).

The new release is available in the Central Maven repository.  Consult the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-marc4j) for more information.
